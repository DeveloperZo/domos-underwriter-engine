## 7. VALUATION

### Method 1: Sales Comparable Approach
- **Weighted Average Price/Unit:** $131,652
- **Subject Units:** 526
- **Indicated Value:** $69,249,152

### Method 2: Income Approach (In-Place)
**Insufficient Data** - Market cap rates not provided in sales comparable data

### Method 3: Income Approach (Stabilized)
**Insufficient Data** - Market cap rates not provided in sales comparable data

---

## 8. KEY ASSUMPTIONS & STANDARDS

### Standard Assumptions:
- Loss to Lease in Stabilized: 3%
- Other Income: Always based on T12 reported "Other Income" items specifically (does not scale with stabilized rents)
- Management Fee: 4% of EGI
- Replacement Reserves: Not calculated as part of In-Place or Stabilized NOI
- Insurance: Always based on T12 figures
- Stabilization Period: 12-24 months

### Valuation Rules:
- Always use greater of in-place or market rents for stabilized value
- Cap rates and theoretical sale price per unit should reflect property quality and market conditions
- Provide two terminal valuation estimates – one based on cap rate, and the other based on sales price per unit
- Adjust for property-specific risks (age, location, condition)
- Consider time value for unstabilized properties
