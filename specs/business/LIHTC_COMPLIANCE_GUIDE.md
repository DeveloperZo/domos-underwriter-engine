# LIHTC Compliance Guide

## Overview
The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program is a critical component of affordable housing finance. This guide provides comprehensive information on LIHTC compliance requirements and processes.

## Program Basics

### LIHTC Fundamentals
- Created by Tax Reform Act of 1986
- Administered by state housing finance agencies
- Provides federal tax credits for affordable housing development
- Two types: 9% credits (new construction) and 4% credits (acquisition/rehab)

### Credit Calculation
```
Annual Credit = Qualified Basis × Applicable Fraction × Applicable Percentage
```

### Key Terms
- **Qualified Basis**: Eligible development costs
- **Applicable Fraction**: Percentage of low-income units
- **Applicable Percentage**: IRS-set percentage (approximately 9% or 4%)

## Compliance Requirements

### Rent Restrictions
