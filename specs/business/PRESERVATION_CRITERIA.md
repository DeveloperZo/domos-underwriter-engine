# Preservation Criteria

## Overview
This document outlines the specific criteria and standards used to evaluate affordable housing preservation opportunities within the Domos investment framework.

## Preservation Philosophy

### Definition of Preservation
Preservation involves acquiring and improving existing affordable housing properties to:
- Maintain long-term affordability
- Improve physical and operational conditions
- Enhance resident quality of life
- Prevent market-rate conversion

### Strategic Importance
- **At-Risk Properties**: Properties facing affordability restrictions expiration
- **Market Pressures**: Properties in gentrifying or appreciating markets
- **Physical Deterioration**: Properties requiring significant capital improvements
- **Operational Challenges**: Properties with management or financial issues

## Property Identification Criteria

### Affordability Risk Factors
- Expiring use restrictions (LIHTC, Section 8, other programs)
- Owner interest in market-rate conversion
- Rising market rents relative to restricted rents
- Weak owner financial capacity for improvements

### Physical Condition Indicators
- Deferred maintenance accumulation
- Systems nearing end of useful life
- Code violations or habitability issues
- Energy efficiency deficiencies

### Market Conditions
- Neighborhood gentrification pressure
- Limited affordable housing supply
- Strong rental market fundamentals
- Public transportation access

## Evaluation Framework

### Priority Scoring Matrix

#### Preservation Urgency (40% weight)
- **High (8-10 points)**: Immediate risk of loss or conversion
- **Medium (5-7 points)**: Risk within 2-3 years
- **Low (1-4 points)**: Long-term preservation opportunity

#### Community Impact (30% weight)
- **High (8-10 points)**: Critical community asset, limited alternatives
- **Medium (5-7 points)**: Important housing resource
- **Low (1-4 points)**: One of several options in area

#### Financial Viability (20% weight)
- **High (8-10 points)**: Strong cash flow and value creation potential
- **Medium (5-7 points)**: Adequate returns with reasonable risk
- **Low (1-4 points)**: Marginal economics or high risk

#### Strategic Fit (10% weight)
- **High (8-10 points)**: Perfect alignment with portfolio strategy
- **Medium (5-7 points)**: Good fit with some considerations
- **Low (1-4 points)**: Requires justification for fit

### Minimum Qualification Thresholds
