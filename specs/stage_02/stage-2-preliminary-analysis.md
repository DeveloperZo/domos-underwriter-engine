## Financial Analysis Framework

### Core Financial Model Components
1. **Revenue Analysis** - Current and projected rental income
2. **Operating Expense Analysis** - Historical and projected costs
3. **Capital Expenditure Planning** - Required improvements and timing
4. **Financing Structure** - Debt capacity and optimal leverage
5. **Return Calculations** - IRR, LIRR, equity multiple scenarios

## Step-by-Step Analysis Process

### Step 1: Financial Data Validation & Revenue Analysis

#### Current Rent Analysis
Parse rent roll to determine:
- In-place rents by unit type
- Occupancy rate and vacancy patterns
- Lease expiration schedule
- Tenant payment history

#### Income Analysis
Calculate core income metrics:
```
Gross Scheduled Rent = Sum of all unit rents × 12
Vacancy Loss = Historical vacancy % or market standard (5-8%)
Effective Gross Income = GSR - Vacancy Loss + Other Income
```

#### Market Rent Assessment
```
Research Process:
1. Identify 3-5 comparable properties within 3 miles
2. Adjust for property age, condition, amenities
3. Factor in LIHTC rent restrictions
4. Calculate market rent potential by unit type
```

#### Revenue Projections (5-Year Preliminary)
- Year 1: Current rents + immediate adjustments for vacant units
- Years 2-5: Annual rent growth of 2-4% (within LIHTC limits)
- Account for annual turnover and vacancy loss (5-8%)
- Consider post-compliance rent growth potential

### Step 2: Operating Expense Analysis

#### Historical Expense Review
Parse T12 operating statement for:
- Property taxes and insurance
- Utilities (tenant vs owner paid)
- Maintenance and repairs
- Management fees
- Administrative costs

#### Expense Analysis
Calculate operating metrics:
```
Operating Expenses = Property taxes + Insurance + Utilities + 
                    Maintenance + Management + Administrative
Operating Expense Ratio = Operating Expenses / Effective Gross Income
Target Range: 35-50% (varies by market and property type)
```

#### Expense Projections
- Property taxes: Annual increase 2-3%
- Insurance: Annual increase 3-5%
- Utilities: Annual increase 3-4%
- Maintenance: Increase with property age
- Management: Typically 3-5% of gross income

#### Net Operating Income
```
Net Operating Income (NOI) = Effective Gross Income - Operating Expenses
NOI per Unit = NOI / Total Units
Target: $3,000-8,000 per unit (market dependent)
```

### Step 3: Capital Expenditure Planning (Preliminary)

#### Immediate Capital Needs Assessment
- Deferred maintenance items
- Health/safety compliance requirements
- Unit turn costs and upgrades
- Common area improvements

#### Capital Budget Guidelines (Preliminary)
- Immediate needs: $5,000-$15,000 per unit
- Annual reserves: $300-$500 per unit per year
- Major replacements: Budget based on useful life

### Step 4: Valuation Metrics

#### Cap Rate Analysis
```
Going-in Cap Rate = Current NOI / Asking Price
Market Cap Rate = Research recent sales for comparable properties
Cap Rate Delta = Going-in Cap Rate - Market Cap Rate
```

#### Price per Unit Analysis
```
Price per Unit = Asking Price / Total Units
Market Price per Unit = Recent comparable sales average
Price Premium/Discount = (Price per Unit - Market Price per Unit) / Market Price per Unit
```

### Step 5: Preliminary Return Analysis

#### Financing Analysis (Preliminary)
```
Debt Capacity Calculation:
Maximum Debt = (Net Operating Income × DSCR Factor) / Debt Service Coverage
Target DSCR: 1.25x minimum
Loan Terms: 30-year amortization, current market rates

Optimal Capital Structure:
- Target leverage: 70-80% LTV
- Preferred debt: Agency financing (Fannie/Freddie)
- Equity requirement: 20-30% of total cost
```

#### Basic Cash Flow Projection
```
Financing Assumptions:
- Loan-to-Value: 70-80% (typical for multifamily)
- Interest Rate: Current market rates + 50bp buffer
- Debt Service Coverage: Target 1.25x minimum

5-Year Pro Forma:
- Project NOI growth based on rent/expense assumptions
- Estimate exit value using market cap rate
- Calculate basic IRR and cash-on-cash returns
```

#### Key Return Metrics (Preliminary)
Calculate for base case scenario:

**Leveraged Returns:**
- IRR (Internal Rate of Return)
- LIRR (Leveraged IRR at 10% target return)
- Equity Multiple
- Cash-on-Cash returns by year

**Unleveraged Returns:**
- Property-level IRR
- Cap rate on exit
- Total return on investment

## Decision Criteria
