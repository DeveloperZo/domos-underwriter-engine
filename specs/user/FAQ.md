# Domos AI Investment Committee - Frequently Asked Questions

## ü§î General Questions

### Q: What exactly does the Domos AI system do?
**A:** The Domos AI system is a hybrid human-AI tool for analyzing LIHTC preservation investment opportunities. You remain in complete control of all investment decisions, while the AI handles data processing, document analysis, and audit trail management. Think of it as an extremely sophisticated analytical assistant that never gets tired and never forgets to document decisions.

### Q: Will the AI make investment decisions for me?
**A:** No, absolutely not. You make every investment decision. The AI processes documents, extracts data, applies your analysis criteria, and presents information for your review. All investment judgments, risk assessments, and go/no-go decisions are made by you as the investment professional.

### Q: How does this integrate with our existing investment process?
**A:** The system maps to standard institutional investment workflows with gates at each stage. You can customize the stage specifications to match your firm's specific criteria. The output generates standard IC memos and presentations that integrate seamlessly with existing investment committee processes.

### Q: Is our deal data secure?
**A:** Yes, all processing happens locally in your environment. No deal data is transmitted externally. The system creates local files and maintains audit trails entirely within your secure infrastructure.

## üîß Technical Questions

### Q: What file formats does the system accept?
**A:** The system works best with:
- **Excel files** (.xlsx) for financial statements and rent rolls
- **PDF files** (text-searchable) for leases and legal documents  
- **Word documents** (.docx) for reports and memoranda
- **Image files** are supported but text extraction may be limited

### Q: How long does it take to process a deal?
**A:** Initial processing (converting DueDiligence to structured data) typically takes 5-15 minutes depending on document volume. Each stage analysis can be completed in 1-4 hours depending on complexity. Total time from intake to IC decision is usually 1-3 business days vs. weeks for manual analysis.

### Q: Can I modify the stage specifications?
**A:** Yes, all stage specifications are stored as markdown files in the `/specs/` directory. You can modify criteria, add requirements, or customize the analysis framework to match your firm's specific standards.

### Q: What if the AI makes an error in data extraction?
**A:** All extracted data is stored in editable JSON files. You can manually correct any errors and document the changes in the analysis journey. The system is designed to be transparent so you can always verify and override AI outputs.

### Q: How does the audit trail work?
**A:** Every action is automatically timestamped and recorded in an `AnalysisJourney.md` file. This includes your analysis notes, decisions, pipeline movements, and any data corrections. The result is a complete, human-readable audit trail for regulatory compliance and quality assurance.

## üìä Data and Analysis Questions

### Q: How accurate is the financial data extraction?
**A:** Financial extraction accuracy depends on document quality. Well-formatted Excel files typically achieve 95%+ accuracy. PDF financial statements may require manual verification. Always review extracted financial data before relying on it for investment decisions.

### Q: What if the property information is wrong?
**A:** Property information can be corrected by editing the `deal.json` file directly. Document any changes in the analysis journey with the source of the corrected information. Consider re-processing if the source documents can be improved.

### Q: Can the system handle mixed-use properties?
**A:** Yes, the system handles various property types including mixed-use. Make sure to provide detailed rent rolls that separate residential and commercial components. The analysis may require custom modifications for complex mixed-use structures.

### Q: How does LIHTC compliance tracking work?
**A:** The system extracts LIHTC compliance information from available documents and tracks key dates like compliance period end and extended use expiration. You should verify this information against official LIHTC documents and update as needed.

### Q: What market data does the system use?
**A:** The system processes market data that you provide in the DueDiligence package. It does not automatically pull external market data, giving you control over data sources and ensuring consistency with your firm's market analysis standards.

## üöÄ Workflow Questions

### Q: Do I have to follow the stages in order?
**A:** The standard workflow is designed to be followed sequentially, with each stage building on the previous analysis. However, you can move deals directly to later stages if appropriate, or create custom stage sequences for special situations.

### Q: Can I go back to a previous stage?
**A:** Yes, you can move deals backward through the pipeline if additional analysis is needed. Document the reason for the move in the analysis journey to maintain a clear audit trail.

### Q: What if I need to pause analysis on a deal?
**A:** Keep the deal in the "in-progress" substate of its current stage. Document the reason for the pause and any next steps in the analysis journey. The deal can be resumed at any time with full context preserved.

### Q: How do I prioritize multiple deals?
**A:** The system doesn't automatically prioritize deals, but you can use the pipeline folder structure and analysis journeys to track urgency, quality, and resource requirements. Consider adding priority fields to the deal.json structure if needed.

### Q: Can I batch process multiple deals?
**A:** Currently, each deal is processed individually to maintain quality and control. However, you can have multiple deals at different pipeline stages simultaneously. Future versions may support batch processing for similar deal types.
