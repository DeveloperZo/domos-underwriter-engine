2. Adjust for property age, condition, amenities
3. Factor in LIHTC rent restrictions and timing
4. Calculate market rent potential by unit type
5. Assess competitive positioning and differentiation
```

#### Pro Forma Income Projections (15-Year)
```
Year-by-Year Projections:
- Rent increases: Market-driven and regulatory-compliant
- Vacancy and collection loss: Historical and market comparison
- Turnover timing: Based on lease expiration schedule
